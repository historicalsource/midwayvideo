Version 1.1 - 13 Feb 97
-----------------------

Changed over to Watcom. Added -v and -m options to set engine volume
and master volume on command line. Added keys for selecting drones in
addition to player sound. Made 'esc' and 'q' different - q leaves
sounds running on exit (e.g. for debug).


Version 1.0 - 7 Oct 96
----------------------

Simple utility to test / debug the DCS2 engine sound. Cabbaged
together from QCOMM.

55E0 ssvv 00pp

ss = pitch or speed byte, 0=slowest, 255=fastest

vv = volume byte for the engine sound (equivalent to track volume for a
     normal compression track)
   
     0=off, 1=softest, 255=loudest

pp = pan byte, 0=hard left, 127=middle, 255=hard right

p  select player as current sound

1  select drone1 as current sound

2  select drone2 as current sound
     
l  pan left

r  pan right

e  toggle current sound on and off

left cursor key - decrease pitch, slow down

right cursor key - increase pitch, speed up

up cursor key - increase volume
